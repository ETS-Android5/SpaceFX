## SpaceFX
A simple tiny space game written in JavaFX.

The "dev" branch contains new developments that might come to the game later on. The "simpleversion" branch is like the name says more simple and should also run on
embedded devices etc. 
The "master" branch now contains some more fun things like enemies attacking in waves, a level boss that needs more hits to kill, enemies that drop bombs and an
enemy boss that also fires rockets.
This "mobile" branch is like the name says for mobile devices, it contains exactly the same code that is used in the "master" branch but needs some adjustments.
At the moment you cannot use sound on the mobile platform so this has to be disabled and other things.
Be aware that the "mobile" branch is using maven where the other branches use gradle, this will change in the future and is only temporary.
